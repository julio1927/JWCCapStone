JWC Capstone Project

### Project Description
The purpose for `GrowthWatch` is to gather various plant metrics such as; plant height and check the plant growth.

### The Problem 
The problem that we are facing is that the current gathering of metrics is all manual. This means that the company has plant biologist that constantly gather information about their crops and growth strategies to review and study. As stated previously, this is a manual process which is very time consuming and therefore expensive.

### Our Solution 
Our solution to this problem is to add automation to this manual process by creating an application that gathers the plant metrics in a time effective manner. This will inturn reduce the time it takes to gather metrics and increase the bottom line profit.
